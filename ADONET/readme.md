# Overview of ADO.Net

## What is ADO.Net?
ADO.Net (ActiveX Data Objects .Net) is a set of classes that expose data access services for .Net Framework programmers. It is an integral part of the .Net Framework, providing access to relational data, XML, and application data. ADO.Net is designed to be an efficient and scalable data access solution for both connected and disconnected architectures.

## Key Components of ADO.Net
### 1. Data Providers
ADO.Net uses data providers to interact with different types of data sources. A data provider is a set of classes that allows you to connect to a data source, execute commands, and retrieve results. The key data providers in ADO.Net are:
- `SqlClient`: For SQL Server
- `OleDb`: For OLE DB data sources
- `Odbc`: For ODBC data sources
- `OracleClient`: For Oracle databases

### 2. Connection
A `Connection` object represents a connection to a data source. It is used to establish a session with the data source and manage the connection's lifecycle. Examples include `SqlConnection` for SQL Server and `OleDbConnection` for OLE DB data sources.

### 3. Command
A `Command` object is used to execute SQL queries and stored procedures against a data source. It can be used to perform various operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Examples include `SqlCommand` for SQL Server and `OleDbCommand` for OLE DB data sources.

### 4. DataReader
A `DataReader` object provides a fast, forward-only, read-only cursor for accessing data. It is used to retrieve data from a data source in a connected environment. Examples include `SqlDataReader` for SQL Server and `OleDbDataReader` for OLE DB data sources.

### 5. DataAdapter
A `DataAdapter` object acts as a bridge between a `DataSet` and a data source. It is used to retrieve data from a data source and populate the `DataSet`, as well as to update the data source with changes made to the `DataSet`. Examples include `SqlDataAdapter` for SQL Server and `OleDbDataAdapter` for OLE DB data sources.

### 6. DataSet
A `DataSet` is an in-memory representation of data that can hold multiple tables and relationships between them. It is used in disconnected scenarios where data is retrieved from a data source, manipulated in-memory, and then updated back to the data source.

## Connected vs. Disconnected Architecture
### Connected Architecture
In a connected architecture, the application maintains a continuous connection to the data source while performing operations. Data is accessed and manipulated directly on the data source using objects like `Connection`, `Command`, and `DataReader`.

### Disconnected Architecture
In a disconnected architecture, the application retrieves data from the data source, manipulates it in-memory, and then updates the data source. The `DataSet` and `DataAdapter` objects are used to implement this architecture, allowing the application to work with data without maintaining a continuous connection to the data source.

## Benefits of ADO.Net
- Scalability: Supports both connected and disconnected architectures.
- Flexibility: Provides multiple data providers for different types of data sources.
- Performance: Optimized for efficient data access and manipulation.
- Interoperability: Supports various data sources, including relational databases, XML, and application data.

## Conclusion
ADO.Net is a powerful and flexible data access technology that provides a comprehensive set of classes for interacting with different types of data sources. Whether you need to work with relational data, XML, or application data, ADO.Net offers the tools and capabilities to build robust and scalable data-driven applications.

# Using LINQ with ADO.Net

## What is LINQ?
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful querying language introduced in .Net Framework 3.5 that allows developers to write queries directly within their code using a consistent syntax. LINQ provides a unified approach to querying different types of data sources, such as databases, XML, collections, and more.

## LINQ to DataSet
ADO.Net provides LINQ to DataSet, which allows you to use LINQ queries on `DataSet` objects. This enables you to perform complex queries and transformations on in-memory data using a clean and expressive syntax.

### Example: LINQ to DataSet
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Customers";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(query, connection);
            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(dataSet, "Customers");

            // Using LINQ to query the DataSet
            var customers = dataSet.Tables["Customers"].AsEnumerable()
                .Where(row => row.Field<string>("Country") == "USA")
                .Select(row => new
                {
                    CustomerID = row.Field<string>("CustomerID"),
                    CompanyName = row.Field<string>("CompanyName"),
                    ContactName = row.Field<string>("ContactName")
                });

            foreach (var customer in customers)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {customer.CustomerID}, Name: {customer.CompanyName}, Contact: {customer.ContactName}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## LINQ to SQL
LINQ to SQL is a component of LINQ that provides a runtime infrastructure for managing relational data as objects. It allows you to query and manipulate data from a SQL Server database using LINQ syntax. LINQ to SQL automatically translates LINQ queries into SQL queries, making it easier to work with relational data in a strongly-typed manner.

### Example: LINQ to SQL
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Data.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        DataContext dataContext = new DataContext(connectionString);

        // Querying the database using LINQ to SQL
        var customers = dataContext.GetTable<Customer>()
            .Where(c => c.Country == "USA")
            .Select(c => new
            {
                c.CustomerID,
                c.CompanyName,
                c.ContactName
            });

        foreach (var customer in customers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ID: {customer.CustomerID}, Name: {customer.CompanyName}, Contact: {customer.ContactName}");
        }
    }
}

public class Customer
{
    public string CustomerID { get; set; }
    public string CompanyName { get; set; }
    public string ContactName { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
}
```

## Benefits of Using LINQ with ADO.Net
- **Improved Readability**: LINQ queries are more readable and expressive compared to traditional SQL queries embedded as strings.
- **Compile-time Checking**: LINQ provides compile-time checking of query syntax and data types, reducing runtime errors.
- **IntelliSense Support**: LINQ queries benefit from IntelliSense support in Visual Studio, enhancing developer productivity.
- **Consistent Syntax**: LINQ provides a consistent querying syntax for different types of data sources, reducing the learning curve.

## Conclusion

Using LINQ with ADO.Net enhances data access and manipulation by providing a more readable, type-safe, and consistent querying experience. Whether you're working with in-memory data using LINQ to DataSet or querying a SQL Server database using LINQ to SQL, LINQ simplifies and streamlines data operations in your .Net applications.

```markdown name=Data_Access_Techniques_with_ADO.Net.md
# Data Access Techniques with ADO.Net

## Introduction
ADO.Net provides a variety of techniques for accessing and manipulating data from different data sources. These techniques include connected and disconnected data access models, which offer flexibility depending on the application's requirements.

## Connected Data Access
In connected data access, the application maintains an open connection to the data source while performing operations. This model is suitable for scenarios where real-time data access and immediate updates are required.

### Using `SqlConnection`
The `SqlConnection` object is used to establish a connection to a SQL Server database. It manages the connection's lifecycle, including opening and closing the connection.

### Example: Connected Data Access
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Customers";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();

            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {reader["CustomerID"]}, Name: {reader["CompanyName"]}, Contact: {reader["ContactName"]}");
            }

            reader.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

## Disconnected Data Access
In disconnected data access, the application retrieves data from the data source, manipulates it in-memory, and then updates the data source. This model is suitable for scenarios where data can be cached and processed offline.

### Using `DataSet` and `DataAdapter`
The `DataSet` object is an in-memory representation of data that can hold multiple tables and relationships. The `DataAdapter` object acts as a bridge between the `DataSet` and the data source, allowing data retrieval and updates.

### Example: Disconnected Data Access
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Customers";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(query, connection);
            DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
            adapter.Fill(dataSet, "Customers");

            // Displaying data from the DataSet
            foreach (DataRow row in dataSet.Tables["Customers"].Rows)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {row["CustomerID"]}, Name: {row["CompanyName"]}, Contact: {row["ContactName"]}");
            }

            // Making changes to the DataSet
            DataRow newRow = dataSet.Tables["Customers"].NewRow();
            newRow["CustomerID"] = "NEWID";
            newRow["CompanyName"] = "New Company";
            newRow["ContactName"] = "New Contact";
            dataSet.Tables["Customers"].Rows.Add(newRow);

            // Updating the data source with changes made to the DataSet
            SqlCommandBuilder commandBuilder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);
            adapter.Update(dataSet, "Customers");
        }
    }
}
```

## Executing Commands
ADO.Net provides the `SqlCommand` object for executing SQL queries and stored procedures against a data source. The `CommandType` property can be set to `Text` for SQL queries or `StoredProcedure` for stored procedures.

### Example: Executing Commands
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        string query = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName) VALUES (@CustomerID, @CompanyName, @ContactName)";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@CustomerID", "NEWID");
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@CompanyName", "New Company");
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ContactName", "New Contact");

            int rowsAffected = command.ExecuteNonQuery();
            Console.WriteLine($"Rows affected: {rowsAffected}");
        }
    }
}
```

## Using Transactions
ADO.Net supports transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency. The `SqlTransaction` object is used to manage transactions.

### Example: Using Transactions
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            SqlTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction();

            try
            {
                SqlCommand command1 = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1", connection, transaction);
                SqlCommand command2 = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2", connection, transaction);

                command1.ExecuteNonQuery();
                command2.ExecuteNonQuery();

                transaction.Commit();
                Console.WriteLine("Transaction committed.");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                transaction.Rollback();
                Console.WriteLine($"Transaction rolled back: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

ADO.Net provides a flexible and powerful set of techniques for accessing and manipulating data from various data sources. Whether using connected or disconnected data access models, executing commands, or managing transactions, ADO.Net offers the tools and capabilities to build robust data-driven applications.

# Comparing ADO.Net with Entity Framework

## Introduction
ADO.Net and Entity Framework are both data access technologies provided by Microsoft, but they serve different purposes and offer different features. This comparison highlights the key differences between ADO.Net and Entity Framework to help you understand their use cases, strengths, and weaknesses.

## ADO.Net
ADO.Net is a low-level data access technology that provides a set of classes for interacting with various data sources, such as relational databases, XML files, and more. It offers both connected and disconnected data access models, giving developers fine-grained control over data operations.

### Key Features of ADO.Net
- **Direct Database Access**: Provides direct access to the database using SQL queries and stored procedures.
- **Disconnected Data Access**: Supports disconnected data access using `DataSet` and `DataAdapter`.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Offers low-level control over database operations, connections, commands, and transactions.
- **Performance**: Optimized for high performance and efficient data access.

### Example: ADO.Net
```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "your_connection_string";
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Customers";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();

            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {reader["CustomerID"]}, Name: {reader["CompanyName"]}, Contact: {reader["ContactName"]}");
            }

            reader.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

## Entity Framework
Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It abstracts the database layer, enabling developers to interact with data using LINQ queries and strongly-typed objects.

### Key Features of Entity Framework
- **ORM**: Provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that maps database tables to .Net classes.
- **Code First, Database First, and Model First**: Supports multiple development approaches (Code First, Database First, and Model First).
- **LINQ Integration**: Enables querying and manipulating data using LINQ syntax.
- **Change Tracking**: Automatically tracks changes made to objects and updates the database accordingly.
- **Lazy Loading and Eager Loading**: Supports lazy loading and eager loading of related data.

### Example: Entity Framework
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (var context = new MyDbContext())
        {
            var customers = context.Customers
                .Where(c => c.Country == "USA")
                .Select(c => new
                {
                    c.CustomerID,
                    c.CompanyName,
                    c.ContactName
                });

            foreach (var customer in customers)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {customer.CustomerID}, Name: {customer.CompanyName}, Contact: {customer.ContactName}");
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Customer
{
    public string CustomerID { get; set; }
    public string CompanyName { get; set; }
    public string ContactName { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
}

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
}
```
